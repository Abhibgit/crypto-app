☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used.

My code:

☐ The "main" Mongoose model: coin.js

☐ My favorite EJS template: end.ejs. Demonstartion: http://localhost:3000/donotpush

☐ The controller for the main model: coins.js

MongoDb, Mongoose, javascript, css and Heroku.

Technical Requirements:

☐ Have at least 2 data entities. One entity that represents the main functional idea for your app and another with a 1:M or M:M relationship with that main entity (embedded or referenced).

☐ Have full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features. For example, you can have functionality that Creates & Updates a post and satisfy Delete functionality by implementing the ability to delete comments.

☐ Getting Started:

Include a link to the deployed app: http://localhost:3000/cmbCrypto

Trello board with the project's planning: https://trello.com/b/BGgxzicR/user-stories

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items)

- Live price update due to third paty API's
- Retail store for crypto currency mining equipment.
- Set up Oauth.
- Set up exchanges links.

The Experience:

☐ My Biggest Challenge?:

- Implementing update and delete properly.

- CSS.

☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?

- How to Create my Database and populate it.
- How to create the basic bones for my future app.
